# Check-MailboxCompromise Module

## Future Intent
My intent is for this module to eventually become part of a fully menu-driven toolbox. This toolbox will enable users to perform various administrative tasks such as:

Running mailbox checks for compromise
Changing passwords
Disabling accounts
Removing rules
This will streamline and simplify the management of Exchange Online environments, making it easier for administrators to maintain security and efficiency.

## Prerequisites

- **PowerShell 5.1 or later**
- **Exchange Online Management Module**: Ensure you have the Exchange Online Management module installed. You can install it using the following command:
  ```powershell
  Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -Force -AllowClobber

## Installation
Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/stevenservo-hub/Check-Mailbox-Compromise.git`

Navigate to the Module Directory: Change to the directory where the module file is located:

`cd Check-Mailbox-Compromise`

Import the Module: Import the MailboxCompromise.psm1 module into your PowerShell session:

`Import-Module -Path ".\MailboxCompromise.psm1"`

## Usage
To use the Check-MailboxCompromise function, you need to provide the Exchange Online administratorâ€™s User Principal Name (UPN). You can also specify the -QuickRun flag to perform a quick check.
